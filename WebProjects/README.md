Camagru was my first web project where I needed to create instagram like site
where users can upload photos. I did this with php using MySQL as my database.

Matcha was my second project were we created a dating site. We did this using react,
js and nodejs, using postGreSQL as our database.

Hypertube was my third project where we created video streaming site that uses
torrents. We did this using react, js, nodejs and using mongoDB as out database.
