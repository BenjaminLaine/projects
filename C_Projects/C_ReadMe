Piscine_Reloaded is very basic introduction into coding. I learner some basic
shell usage and some basic C functions.

Libft was more basic C. Idea was to rewrite alot of basic functions from C.
This way I learned how to write and work with C.

Get_Next_Line was more basic C. I needed to make a program that reads lines from
a file.

Fillit was more technical, in this we needed to create a program that takes in
tetris blocks and our program fits all the blocks into smalles square possible.

Ft_ls idea is to copy functionality of shell command ls. In this project I learned
the importance of structuring my code into functional pieces.

Ft_printf idea is to mimic printf functionality. In this project it was important
to plan how to take everything into account since printf is quite a sizable function.
